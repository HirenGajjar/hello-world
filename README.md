# hello-world
This is the first repository for the DGL 123 Class

My name is Hiren, and at the end of the course, I expect myself to be able to code sufficiently for **web development**.

Web development has mainly two components
- Front End
- Back End

Also, my focus is on learning different technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JS.
